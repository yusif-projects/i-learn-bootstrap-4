# Me learning Bootstrap 4.
###### I need a portfolio website and I want to write one by myself. But, I had web-programming classes in university, and as I remember, creating a nice looking website while not using Bootstrap or any other third party framework is very hard. So, searched for tutorials. And now, I'm in the learning process.
