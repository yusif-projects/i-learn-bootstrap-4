# Learning Bootstrap 4
###### I need a portfolio website and I want to write one by myself. But, I had web-programming classes in university, and as I remember, creating a nice looking website while not using Bootstrap or any other third party framework is very hard. So, I searched for some tutorials on YouTube. Now, I'm in the learning process.
#### These are what I've learned so far:
* Containers
* Jumbotrons
* Cards
* Utilities
* Typography
* Navs
* Footers
* Nav Bars
